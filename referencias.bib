	abstract = {El presente trabajo es un software educativo para el estudio de la materia  de Inteligencia artificial, fue desarrollado con la finalidad de conocer más a fondo las  principales  técnicas, conceptos y   aplicaciones que servirán para el aprendizaje de estos temas a los   estudiantes de Informática de la Escuela Superior Politécnica de Chimborazo. En los recursos utilizados pudimos contar con  tecnología para la Web utilizando el entorno de programación {PHP}, {MySQL}, Apache. Para el diseño utilizamos  la herramienta Dreamweaver como editor de páginas Web. Utilizamos técnicas pedagógicas pues es un sistema de aprendizaje. Mediante este Sistema se accede a la información  de Inteligencia Artificial  y apoyo  a los estudiantes a comprender  estos  temas para aprender, evaluarse y además  mediante un análisis  de los resultados se evidenció que un 80\% se  mejora el aprendizaje de las técnicas y conceptos de Inteligencia Artificial. Brinda una interfaz amigable de navegación, la cual  tuvo  una gran  aceptación y  fue comprobada su utilidad  mediante la prueba de implementación  y puesta en marcha  en la Red  durante 15 días, al cual  accedieron 50 usuarios quienes mediante la aplicación de entrevistas y encuestas permitieron conocer la satisfacción del 90\%  de la labor desarrollada. Se concluye que este software educativo de Inteligencia Artificial desarrollado puede ser utilizado para el aprendizaje de esta materia. Recomendamos  utilizar este software en el curriculum de la facultad  para el desarrollo de la Inteligencia Artificial en la  Escuela de Informática.},

This study brings together the fields of cooperative learning, second language acquisition, as well as second/foreign language teaching to create optimal schooling experiences for students. The major findings of this study suggested that cooperative learning helped significantly to enhance the junior high school learners’ oral communicative competence and their motivation toward learning English. Based upon the conclusions drawn from the study, cooperative learning was thus recommended to be integrated into the school English instruction as part of the Curriculum. As a result, the effects of cooperative learning seem salient in enhancing the {EFL} junior high school students’ language learning.},

The high level of drop out percentage has been a problem at Helsinki University of Technology for many years. This course has yearly enrolment of 500-600 students and the drop out percentage has varied from 30-50 {percents.Since} we did not have clear picture of drop out reasons we conducted a qualitative interview research in which 18 dropouts from the {CS1} course were interviewed. The reasons of drop out were categorized and, in addition, each case was investigated individually. This procedure enabled us to both list the reasons and to reveal the cumulative nature of drop out {reasons.The} results indicate that several reasons affect students' decision to quit the {CS1} course. The most frequent reasons were the lack of time and the lack of motivation. However, both of these reasons were in turn affected by factors, such as the perceived difficulty of the course, general difficulties with time managing and planning studies, or the decision to prefer something else. Furthermore, low comfort level and plagiarism played a role in drop out. In addition, drop out reasons {cumulated.This} study shows that the complexity and large variety of factors involved in students' decision to drop the course. This indicates that simple actions to improve teaching or organization on a {CS1} course to reduce drop out may be ineffective. Efficient intervention to the problem apparently requires a combination of many different actions that take into consideration the versatile nature of reasons involved in drop out.},

	abstract = {A study by a {ITiCSE} 2001 working group ("the {McCracken} Group") established that many students do not know how to program at the conclusion of their introductory courses. A popular explanation for this incapacity is that the students lack the ability to problem-solve. That is, they lack the ability to take a problem description, decompose it into sub-problems and implement them, then assemble the pieces into a complete solution. An alternative explanation is that many students have a fragile grasp of both basic programming principles and the ability to systematically carry out routine programming tasks, such as tracing (or "desk checking") through code. This {ITiCSE} 2004 working group studied the alternative explanation, by testing students from seven countries, in two ways. First, students were tested on their ability to predict the outcome of executing a short piece of code. Second, students were tested on their ability, when given the desired function of short piece of near-complete code, to select the correct completion of the code from a small set of possibilities. Many students were weak at these tasks, especially the latter task, suggesting that such students have a fragile grasp of skills that are a prerequisite for problem-solving.},

The underlying goal of this work was to initiate dialog in the Computer Science community on how to develop these types of assessments.

It has been implemented in four course sections across two semesters. The strategy was assessed from both students and teachers perspective. Assessment results show that between 78\% and 92\% of the students considered that the group work enriched their learning, providing support for the use of cooperative learning. Also, the results from a homework and an exam on the subject show an improvement on the students' learning of relational algebra.},

However, current solutions are suffering couples of disadvantages: low performance, high latency, additional user account to authentication. Therefore, we present a new tool to provide high performance, low latency, and rich element collaborative sketching. Users can login with existing online account, and then both chatting and initialing a painter are allowed with contacts. We achieve this by exploiting {XMPP} (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) for instance message; web sockets (an independent {TCP-based} protocol) for low latency sketching and web workers to offload heavy calculated sketching items to a new thread. We describe our technical solution as well as demonstrate example applications in everyday scenarios.},

	abstract = {Extreme Programming ({XP)} was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of time. {XP} recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they have been earned. Fundamentals of {XP} include: * Distinguishing between the decisions to be made by business interests and those to be made by project stakeholders. * Writing unit tests before programming and keeping all of the tests running at all times. * Integrating and testing the whole system--several times a day. * Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one screen. * Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity. * Putting a minimal system into production quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable. Why is {XP} so controversial? Some sacred cows dont make the cut in {XP:} * Dont force te},

The pair programming and peer-led team learning approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in many campuses. However, in some other campuses with a majority of underrepresented and full-time working students such as our campus, both pair programming approach and peer-led team learning approach may not work well each individually because students either lack motivation in the labs or don't have extra time after class. {MPP} attempts to incorporate both pair programming and peer-led team learning approaches into closed laboratories.

Since our approach is based on the typical infrastructure for teaching introductory computer science courses and does not require additional expenses or special resources, it can be replicated by other institutions.
